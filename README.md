What is your style?
ENTJ

When do you like people to approach you and how?
I like face to face, it makes me more comfortable to know others through the activities or games.

What do you value?
For me, I think personality is the most important one for me to make new friends. If someone's personality is not appropriate with me, I won't want to make a friend with him/her.

How do you like people to communicate with you?
As same as the first question, I like face-to-face more than online. It makes me feel the temperature between others and me, and I can know more about them. If I only message others, sometimes we may mislead their meaning. At work, I like a more direct way of communication, which can increase efficiency.

How do you make decisions?
I am not a one who good at making decision, I always thinking and hesitating about what is my next step because I am afraid to make the wrong decision. Before I making decision, I will thinking by myself first and ask the people around us, especially the large decision. If it is the little thing, I can make the decision myself.

How can people help you?
I think I have many defects, but everyone has defects. Therefore, the thing that others can help is tolerance for the thing I did wrong.

What will you not tolerate in others?
I really hate the bad attitude. If you are late for the teamwork assignment, I can do your part for you. However, if someone has a bad attitude like treating teammates badly. I can't be tolerant of that.
